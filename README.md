# PythonDataScienceProject

This project analyzes data on 10k google play store apps from kaggle.

Valuable data analysis results include the most profitable and most widely used categories of apps, the relationship between the number of installs, rating, and the prices of the apps, etc.

A regression task is performed to predict the number of installs of an app from other statistics available. A similar task can be performed to price an app.
